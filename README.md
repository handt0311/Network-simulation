# Network-simualtion
This project aims to evaluate the performance of the CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) protocol in a WiFi Ad-hoc network using the NS-3 simulator.



## 🚀 How to Run
   1. Move to ns-3 directory:
      ```bash
      cd ~/ns-allinone-3.39/ns-3.39
      ```

   2. Create a symbolic link to the project folder:
     ```bash

      ln -s /home/minh/Network-simulation scratch/my-wifi
      ```
    

   (Note: You can replace "my-wifi" with any folder name)

   3. Build the project:
   ```bash

      ./ns3 build  
      ```

   4. Run the simulation:
      ```bash
      ./ns3 run "my-wifi/traffic" 
      ```

## ⚠️ Note

   Each simulation must contain ONLY ONE main() function.

   Do NOT place multiple .cc files with main() in the same folder (e.g., scratch/my-wifi/),
   because ns-3 will compile them together into a single program, causing a "multiple definition of main" error.

   ❌ Wrong:
   scratch/my-wifi/
      traffic.cc        (has main)
      wifi_setup.cc     (has main)

   ✅ Correct options:

   Option 1 (Recommended):
   Place only ONE .cc file in the folder:
   scratch/my-wifi/
      traffic.cc

   Option 2:
   Use separate folders for each simulation:
   scratch/traffic/traffic.cc
   scratch/wifi_setup/wifi_setup.cc

   👉 Rule: 1 folder = 1 program = 1 main()
